1. Feature Engineering 
2. Tanmay: One ML algorithm
3. Gaurang: XGBoost Algorithm to predict salary based on [experience_level,employment_type,job_title,employee_residence,company_location,company_size]




Good Potential Categorical Features that have been encoded and are ready for ML:
job_title_salary_rank --> Groups similar job titles and ranks those groups by average salary (convert to numeric counterpart)
company_size --> Encoded S,M,L to 1,2,3 
Experience_level_encoded --> maps experience to numerical value.
employment_type_encoded --> Maps employment type to numerical values
work_year --> work year
